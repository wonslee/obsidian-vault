# What

[Spring 공식 문서](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html)

> Spring's web MVC framework is, **like many other web MVC frameworks, request-driven**, designed around a **central Servlet** that dispatches requests to controllers and offers other functionality that facilitates the development of web applications. 
> 
> Spring's `DispatcherServlet` however, does more than just that. It is **completely integrated with the Spring IoC container** and as such allows you to use every other feature that Spring has.
