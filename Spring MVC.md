> The Spring Web model-view-controller (MVC) framework is designed around a **`DispatcherServlet`** that **dispatches requests to handlers**, with configurable handler mappings, view resolution, locale and theme resolution as well as support for uploading files. 
> The default handler is based on the **`@Controller`** and **`@RequestMapping`** annotations, offering a wide range of flexible handling methods. With the introduction of **Spring 3.0**, the `@Controller` mechanism also allows you to create **RESTful** Web sites and applications, through the **`@PathVariable`** annotation and other features.
